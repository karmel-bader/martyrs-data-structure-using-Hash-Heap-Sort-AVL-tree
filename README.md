In this project, a new martyrsâ€™ data structure using AVL tree, heap, and hash is implemented. For a good user experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) using javaFX is implemented. When running the project, at first, the user has to load the martyrs file using a file chooser. Then to load dates of martyrdom in a hash table, every date has an AVL tree of martyrs,  and we used heap sort to sort martyrs based on their age.
